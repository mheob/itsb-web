				<h2>3. General information and mandatory information</h2>

				<h3>Data protection</h3>
				<p>
					The operators of this website and its pages take the protection of
					your personal data very seriously. Hence, we handle your personal data
					as confidential information and in compliance with the statutory data
					protection regulations and this Data Protection Declaration.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whenever you use this website, a variety of personal information will

					It is not possible to completely protect data against third-party
					access.
				</p>

				<h3>
					Information about the responsible party (referred to as the
					&ldquo;controller&rdquo; in the GDPR)
				</h3>
				<p>The data processing controller on this website is:</p>
				<p>
					Alexander Böhm<br />Theodor-Heuss-Str. 1<br />56564 Neuwied<br
					/>Germany
				</p>
				<p>
					Phone: <ContactLink
						protocol="tel:"
						href="+49 160 8206654"
						title="Call me"
						lang={lang}
						client:visible
					/><br />
					E-mail: <ContactLink
						protocol="mailto:"
						href="mail@alex-boehm.dev"
						title="Write me an email"

				<p>
					The controller is the natural person or legal entity that
					single-handedly or jointly with others makes decisions as to the
					purposes of and resources for the processing of personal data (e.g.,
					names, e-mail addresses, etc.).
				</p>

				<h3>Storage duration</h3>
				<p>
					Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this
					privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the
					purpose for which it was collected no longer applies. If you assert a
					justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to data
					processing, your data will be deleted, unless we have other legally
					permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or
					commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion
					will take place after these reasons cease to apply.
				</p>

				<h3>
					General information on the legal basis for the data processing on this
					website
				</h3>
				<p>
					If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal
					data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9 (2)(a) GDPR, if
					special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 (1)
					DSGVO. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal
					data to third countries, the data processing is also based on Art. 49
					(1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the
					access to information in your end device (e.g., via device
					fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally based on &sect;
					25 (1) TDDDG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is
					required for the fulfillment of a contract or for the implementation
					of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art.
					6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, if your data is required for the
					fulfillment of a legal obligation, we process it on the basis of Art.
					6(1)(c) GDPR. Furthermore, the data processing may be carried out on
					the basis of our legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.
					Information on the relevant legal basis in each individual case is
					provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.
				</p>

				<h3>Recipients of personal data</h3>
				<p>
					In the scope of our business activities, we cooperate with various
					external parties. In some cases, this also requires the transfer of
					personal data to these external parties. We only disclose personal
					data to external parties if this is required as part of the
					fulfillment of a contract, if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g.,
					disclosure of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate
					interest in the disclosure pursuant to Art. 6 (1)(f) GDPR, or if
					another legal basis permits the disclosure of this data. When using
					processors, we only disclose personal data of our customers on the
					basis of a valid contract on data processing. In the case of joint
					processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.
				</p>

				<h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h3>
				<p>
					A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject
					to your express consent. You can also revoke at any time any consent
					you have already given us. This shall be without prejudice to the
					lawfulness of any data collection that occurred prior to your
					revocation.
				</p>

				<h3>
					Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to
					object to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)
				</h3>
				<p>
					IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6(1)(E) OR
					(F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING
					OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE
					SITUATION. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE
					PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL BASIS, ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF
					DATA IS BASED, PLEASE CONSULT THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU
					LOG AN OBJECTION, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL
					DATA, UNLESS WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PRESENT COMPELLING PROTECTION
					WORTHY GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA, THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR
					INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCESSING IS
					THE CLAIMING, EXERCISING OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS (OBJECTION
					PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).
				</p>
				<p>
					IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIRECT
					ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR
					AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING AT ANY
					TIME. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS
					AFFILIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL
					DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING
					PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).
				</p>

				<h3>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h3>
				<p>
					In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to
					log a complaint with a supervisory agency, in particular in the member
					state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at
					the place where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a
					complaint is in effect regardless of any other administrative or court
					proceedings available as legal recourses.
				</p>

				<h3>Right to data portability</h3>
				<p>
					You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the
					basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to
					you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you
					should demand the direct transfer of the data to another controller,
					this will be done only if it is technically feasible.
				</p>

				<h3>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
				<p>
					Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the
					right to demand information about your archived personal data, their
					source and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of your
					data at any time. You may also have a right to have your data
					rectified or eradicated. If you have questions about this subject
					matter or any other questions about personal data, please do not
					hesitate to contact us at any time.
				</p>

				<h3>Right to demand processing restrictions</h3>
				<p>
					You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as
					the processing of your personal data is concerned. To do so, you may
					contact us at any time. The right to demand restriction of processing
					applies in the following cases:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data
						archived by us, we will usually need some time to verify this claim.
						During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the
						right to demand that we restrict the processing of your personal
						data.
					</li>
					<li>
						If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an
						unlawful manner, you have the option to demand the restriction of
						the processing of your data instead of demanding the eradication of
						this data.
					</li>
					<li>
						If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to
						exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements, you have the right to
						demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data
						instead of its eradication.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, your
						rights and our rights will have to be weighed against each other. As
						long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have
						the right to demand a restriction of the processing of your personal
						data.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these
					data &ndash; with the exception of their archiving &ndash; may be
					processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend
					legal entitlements or to protect the rights of other natural persons
					or legal entities or for important public interest reasons cited by
					the European Union or a member state of the EU.
				</p>

				<h3>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
				<p>
					For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential
					content, such as purchase orders or inquiries you submit to us as the
					website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption
					program. You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether
					the address line of the browser switches from &ldquo;http://&rdquo; to
					&ldquo;https://&rdquo; and also by the appearance of the lock icon in
					the browser line.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us
					cannot be read by third parties.
				</p>

				<h2>4. Recording of data on this website</h2>

				<h3>Server log files</h3>
				<p>
					The provider of this website and its pages automatically collects and
					stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser
					communicates to us automatically. The information comprises:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The type and version of browser used</li>
					<li>The used operating system</li>
					<li>Referrer URL</li>
					<li>The hostname of the accessing computer</li>
					<li>The time of the server inquiry</li>
					<li>The IP address</li>
				</ul>
				<p>This data is not merged with other data sources.</p>
				<p>
					This data is recorded on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The operator
					of the website has a legitimate interest in the technically error free
					depiction and the optimization of the operator&rsquo;s website. In
					order to achieve this, server log files must be recorded.
				</p>

				<h3>Contact form</h3>
				<p>
					If you submit inquiries to us via our contact form, the information
					provided in the contact form as well as any contact information
					provided therein will be stored by us in order to handle your inquiry
					and in the event that we have further questions. We will not share
					this information without your consent.
				</p>
				<p>
					The processing of these data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, if your
					request is related to the execution of a contract or if it is
					necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures. In all other cases
					the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective
					processing of the requests addressed to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on
					your agreement (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if this has been requested; the
					consent can be revoked at any time.
				</p>
				<p>
					The information you have entered into the contact form shall remain
					with us until you ask us to eradicate the data, revoke your consent to
					the archiving of data or if the purpose for which the information is
					being archived no longer exists (e.g., after we have concluded our
					response to your inquiry). This shall be without prejudice to any
					mandatory legal provisions, in particular retention periods.
				</p>

				<h3>Request by e-mail, telephone, or fax</h3>
				<p>
					If you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your request, including
					all resulting personal data (name, request) will be stored and
					processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not
					pass these data on without your consent.
				</p>
				<p>
					These data are processed on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your
					inquiry is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is required for
					the performance of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the
					data are processed on the basis of our legitimate interest in the
					effective handling of inquiries submitted to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or
					on the basis of your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if it has been
					obtained; the consent can be revoked at any time.
				</p>
				<p>
					The data sent by you to us via contact requests remain with us until
					you request us to delete, revoke your consent to the storage or the
					purpose for the data storage lapses (e.g. after completion of your
					request). Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular statutory
					retention periods - remain unaffected.
